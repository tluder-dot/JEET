# Albert's Marketplace data platform: group repo

This repository is your group's data platform for **Albert's Marketplace**, the
fictional European beauty marketplace of the Data Engineering & Cloud
Infrastructure course (MSA-DAT09-02, Albert School).

It starts almost empty. Every lesson adds a layer on top of the previous one. By
the end of the course it holds the platform your group defends orally:
- ingestion
- a bronze, silver and gold warehouse
- containerised jobs and orchestration
- infrastructure as code
- cost controls and a security baseline

## How this repo grows

| Lesson | What your group adds | Where |
|---|---|---|
| L01 · Architecture decision frame | Data-flow matrix, first ADR, architecture diagram v1, star schema sketch | `docs/` |
| L02 · Object storage foundations | Bronze layer on Cloud Storage, data dictionary v1 | `docs/` |
| L03 · Batch, streaming, CDC | Ingestion pipelines | `ingestion/` |
| L04 · SQL warehouses | Warehouse tables, three costed queries | `docs/` |
| L05 · dbt and the medallion pattern | Silver and gold models, tests | `dbt/` |
| L06 · Packaging data jobs | Dockerfiles for the ingestion job and dbt | `ingestion/`, `dbt/` |
| L07 · Airflow | A scheduled DAG | `orchestration/` |
| L08 · Terraform | The platform as code, `terraform plan` in CI | `infra/`, `.github/workflows/` |
| L09 · FinOps | Labels, a budget alert, one measured optimisation | `infra/`, `docs/` |
| L10 · Security and governance | Least-privilege access, PII redaction, data classification | `infra/`, `dbt/`, `docs/` |

Starter files for later lessons arrive as **pull requests** opened by the
teaching team. Review and merge them like any other change.

## How we work

- **Every change goes through a pull request,** reviewed by another member
  before it reaches `main`.
- **One decision, one ADR** in `docs/adr/`. Every member writes at least one. At
  the oral defence, each of you defends a technical choice unprepared.
- **The commit history is graded.** Commit in small steps, with messages that
  say why.
- **Never commit secrets:** no `.env` files, no service-account keys.
  `.gitignore` blocks the usual names; it cannot catch everything.
- **Keep `docs/architecture.md` current.** It is the diagram you present at the
  defence.
